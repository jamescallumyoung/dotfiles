# dotfiles

Dotfiles are the files used to configure a user environment.
They're highly specific to the user. These are [@jamescallumyoung](https://github.com/jamescallumyoung)'s.

This repo provides a `setup.sh` script that can do three things:

- install dotfiles
- install packages with Homebrew or Flatpak
- perform miscellaneous actions to complete the setup

## Installing Dotfiles

GNU Stow is used to manage the dotfiles in this repo.
It links them into their expected locations in the system, allowing the source files to remain in the Git repo so they can be version controlled.

This repo contains separate directories for each technology group, such as _zsh_ or _node_, to keep things organised.

This repo is structured so that:

- `./dotfiles` is the _stow directory_,
- `./dotfiles/<package_name>` are _package directories_,
- `~` (a.k.a: `$HOME`) is the _target directory_.

You can learn more about what these terms mean in the [the GNU Stow docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html#Terminology).

Stow is invoked by the `setup.sh` script's "install dotfiles" step.


## Installing Packages

This repo contains a process for installing packages.
Packages are specified in a handful of files, and installed by `setup.sh`.

The following package managers are supported:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - "macOS's missing package manager"
- [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) - "The future of apps on Linux"

The packages to install are listed in files within `package-lists/`.

## Installation Guide

The guide below outlines some manual steps that need to be done, followed by a `setup.sh` script that finishes the process.

Note: This guide was created to set up a new macOS device. Linux and Windows are still experimental.

### Prerequisites

Before `setup.sh` can be run, there are some prerequisites that need to be met:

- Git must be installed. See: [docs/installing-git.md](./docs/installing-git.md).

If running the "install packages" step:

- Package managers need to be available. See: [docs/installing-package-managers.md](./docs/installing-package-managers.md).

If running the "install dotfiles" step:

- GNU Stow must be installed. See: [docs/installing-gnu-stow.md](./docs/installing-gnu-stow.md).

If `fzf` is installed, the setup script will use it. This provides an improved user experience and is strongly recommended.

### 1 - Clone this repo

Clone this repo, so we can run the setup script.
The clone location doesn't matter but it's best to put it somewhere where it's clearly infrastructure and not a regular git repo.

```shell
# using SSH (recommended)
git clone git@github.com:jamescallumyoung/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfilesrepo

# using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/jamescallumyoung/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfilesrepo
```

### 2 - Run the setup script

The rest of the setup process is automatic.
Just run the setup script, and provide the required `-r` option:

```shell
cd $HOME/.dotfilesrepo

chmod +x setup.sh
chmod +x ./scripts/*

./setup.sh
```

The script requires some options to be selected and running without arguments will prompt the user for each option.
The script also supports providing options as arguments.

**Options:**

- `-i` which package manager to use. One of [ "homebrew", "flatpak" ].
- `-d` performs a dry run for the "install packages" step

Note: Your password may be required at multiple stages. Some packages may need options to be selected (esp. when using Flatpak). This is not a script you can run unattended.

### Additional manual steps

After running `setup.sh`, there are additional manual steps you may want to take.
These are defined in [docs/post-setup-manual-steps.md](./docs/post-setup-manual-steps.md).
