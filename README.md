# dotfiles

Dotfiles are the files used to configure linux (and macOS) environments.
They're highly specific to the user. These are @jamescallumyoung's.

This repo also contains brewfiles for use with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) ("macOS's missing package manager").
These allow multiple packages and apps to be installed at once.
