From the [docs](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#-lockfile-lazy-lockjson):

> After every update, the local lockfile is updated with the installed revisions. It is recommended to have this file under version control.
> 
> If you use your Neovim config on multiple machines, using the lockfile, you can ensure that the same version of every plugin is installed.
> 
> If you are on another machine, you can do :Lazy restore, to update all your plugins to the version from the lockfile.
